# 🛒 Amazon Clone (⁠づ⁠｡⁠◕⁠‿⁠‿⁠◕⁠｡⁠)⁠づ

This is my **first full website clone**, inspired by Amazon.  
Currently, it’s built with just **HTML & CSS** (no JavaScript yet), so it’s simple and beginner-friendly.  
The purpose is to **learn and grow** by building in public and improving step by step.  

👉 Anyone can jump in and help — whether it’s adding features, improving design, or making it more responsive!
