# 🛒 Amazon Clone (Beginner Project)

This is my **first full website clone**, inspired by Amazon.  
It is built only with **HTML & CSS** (for now). I know it is **not perfect yet**, but that’s the point — I want to **learn and grow** by building in public.  

👉 Anyone can **contribute** to make this project better — by adding JavaScript, improving the design, fixing responsiveness, or anything else you think of!

## ✨ Current Features
- Amazon-like homepage design  
- Product sections (Best Sellers, Top Picks, etc.)  
- Pure HTML & CSS (easy to understand for beginners)  
- Static project, no backend yet  

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements (Contributors Welcome)
This project is still in progress. Some things that can be added:  
- [ ] **JavaScript features** (search, cart, sliders, dropdown menu)  
- [ ] **Better responsiveness** (mobile & tablet view)  
- [ ] **Improved UI/UX** (hover effects, animations, better navbar & footer)  
- [ ] **Image optimization** for faster load  
- [ ] **Dark mode support**  
- [ ] **Accessibility improvements**
